# Release Notes

This is the temporary location for release notes for releases of Kindred. Once the next release goes out, these will be migrated into the ReadTheDocs documentation. This is however I holding place to keep track of significant changes.

### Version 1.1.0 (unreleased)
- Upgraded to new version of Stanford CoreNLP (3.8.0)
- Changed dependency parsing to use standard CoreNLP dep parser (instead of constituency with a conversion).
- Changed evaluation function to not output specific details by default
